# User management

## Database Custom resource

When you create a `Database`, db-operator will create an application user, that full access to the created database. You should use this user for you workloads.

## DbUser Custom Resource
### Intro

If you happen to need more users on your database, you can use `DbUser` Custom Resource

```
# -- Example
---
apiVersion: "kinda.rocks/v1beta1"
kind: DbUser
metadata:
  name: mysql-readwrite
  namespace: default
spec:
  secretName: mysql-readwrite-secret
  accessType: readWrite
  databaseRef: mysql-db
```

### How it's created?

When you apply a manifest like in the example above, db-operator will create a new user on a database instance, to which the wished database belongs.  Let's assume, you have a `DbInstance` **mysql-generic-server**, and a `Database` **mysql-db** that is using the **mysql-generic-server** as a server. When you create a user like in  the example, db-operator will try to find a `Database` specified in `spec.databaseRef` and will create a user using it. But since users are resources that are created per server, but not per database, the user will actually exist on the `DbInstance`.

As a username, ${metadata.namespace}-${metadata.name} of the `DbUser` will be used. That means that after creating a resource from the example manifest, you will have a `default-mysql-readwrite` user on your Mysql server.

Users can only access databases that are deployed to the same namespace, and they, currently, cannot be assigned to multiple databases.

DbInstance creation will trigger a new secret creation as well. You will have a secret in the same namespace, the name of which will be taken from `spec.secretName`, it will contain all the data that is required to connect to the DB

### Credentials templating 

Credentials templating is also available here and functions exactly as described in the [Database](./creatingdatabases.md#creatingdatabases) resource.

### Access Types

`DbUser` supports two access types:
    - readWrite (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
    - readOnly (SELECT)

ReadWrite users can't create and drop tables, because actions like this should be done only by the application user (the one created with the database)
