Please avoid using conventional commits in this repository unless you are comfortable with your commit history being squashed.

We do not have any automation based on commit messages, so conventional commit tags don't provide any value here. They are unlikely to help readers understand what is actually going on in the Git history, while consuming around 10% of the desired 50-character subject limit.

Thanks!

**PS: If you believe that conventional commits are not used, ignore this comment, a reviewer will take a look at it anyway**
